<a name=intro></a><h2>Introduction</h2>
HotPaste plugin, an idea inspired from AutoHotkey hotstrings helps you create hot-words that perform action when you type. The basic actions can be pasting a text from a 
Clipjump channel or through a function.<br>
Raw strings can be pasted from <code>API.pasteText()</code> function whereas clips can be pasted from <code>API.paste(channel, clip)</code> function. The 
<code>pasteText()</code> will only be able to paste unformatted text so for any HTML or picture type of clip, you will have to rely on <code>paste()</code>.
<br>You can create Hotpastes (i.e. "Hot-words") in the <em>plugins\hotpaste.lib\base.ahk</em> file. This file in <b>not distributed</b> by default and you will have 
to run <strong>HotPaste</strong> from the Plugin Manager to have this file created. Once created, you will have to edit the file to add your HotPastes.<br>
After editing <em>base.ahk</em>, <b>restart Clipjump</b> to have your edits loaded.
<br>

<a name=syntax></a><h2>Basic syntax and Usage</h2>
A simple <em>base.ahk</em> goes as-
<pre>
<span class="green">; writing 'cj_site' followed by a space/Enter/Tab will PASTE the site URL</span>
::cj_site::
	API.PasteText("http://clipjump.sourceforge.net")
	return

<span class="green">; writing 'my_add' followed by a space/Enter/Tab will PASTE 2nd clip of channel 0</span>
::my_add::
	API.Paste(0, 2)
 	return
</pre>

The above code creates two HotPastes - <code>cj_site</code> and <code>my_add</code>.
<ul>
	<li>As the comments read, writing <code>cj_site</code> and then pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Tab</kbd> will replace the typed 'cj_site' by 
	<span class="str">http://clipjump.sourceforge.net</span>. The <code><a href="../devList.html#api-pastetext">PasteText()</a></code> function is responsible for pasting this plain text. Note that I have surrounded the literal string in quotes ("").</li>
	<li>The 2nd HotPaste <code>my_add</code> when typed invokes <code><a href="../devList.html#api-paste">Paste()</a></code> function of the API to paste clip 2 of channel 0. The typed text 'my_add' will be replaced by the clip 2 of channel 0 in this case.
		As this time there is no literal string as input, I have not used quotes.</li>
</ul>
<br>
So the basic syntax is - 
<pre>
::HOTPASTE::
	API.Paste or API.pasteText
	return
</pre>
If you have knoweledge of <a href="http://ahkscript.org">AutoHotkey</a>, there is no limit to what HotPaste can do for you. After all, HotPaste is a simple plugin that uses the core feature of AutoHotkey for its purpose.<br>
BTW, this doesn't mean you will have to learn AutoHotkey (AHK) to use it. This simple tutorial will be sufficient.
<br>

<a name=examples></a><h2>Examples</h2>
<h4>Pasting multi-line text</h4>
Multiline separator in Autohotkey is <code>`n</code>. 
<pre>
::longstr::
	API.PasteText("103, Abc road`nCantt. Area`nXyz`nIndia")
	return
</pre>

<br>

<h4>Pasting 2nd clip of current channel</h4>
<code>CN.NG</code> variable contains the current active channel number. See <a href="../devList.html#vars">more variables</a>.
<pre>
::2ndlast::
	API.Paste( CN.NG, 2 )
	return
</pre>
<br>

<a name=notes></a><h2>End notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you <b>resart Clipjump</b> after changing <em>base.ahk</em> to have the changes loaded.
<li>It will be a good idea to <a href="../basic_help.html#fixate">fix</a> clips that you access through <code>API.Paste()</code> because of the simple reason that 
	clip number will change on addition of new clips. It would be better if you maintain all such FIXED clips in an entirely different channel to avoid workflow problems.
</ul>
