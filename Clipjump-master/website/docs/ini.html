<h2>General</h2>
The file settings.ini is used to store the settings of ClipJump. It's located in the same directory where the Clipjump executable resides.
<br>
Clipjump provides <a href="settings.html">several methods</a> to manipulate the settings file
<h2>Advanced Settings</h2>

<h3><a name="syscopy">Setting shortcut to copy to system Clipboard (bypassing Clipjump)</a></h3>
You can also create a unique shortcut in Clipjump to copy/cut data only to System Clipboard and not Clipjump. 
To create these shortcuts, open the [Advanced] section of Settings.ini and write down shortcut values for <var>windows_copy_shortcut</var> and 
<var>windows_cut_shortcut</var>. As you may have guessed, these shortcuts are disabled by default and by writing shortcut values for them in the ini you create them.
<br>These shortcuts can be very useful when in need to copy sensitive or crap information of the Clipboard.
<br><br>

<h3><a name=actmd_keys>Changing Action Mode Easy keys</a></h3>
Action Mode keys can be changed through <a href="custom.html">ClipjumpCustom.ini</a>, please see <a href="custom.html#actmd">this</a> example.<br>
To disable a key, empty its value. In the following example, F1 AND L keys are removed.<br>
{% highlight ini %}
[actionmode_delete_bad_keys]
ACTIONMODE.F1=
ACTIONMODE.L=
{% endhighlight %}
<br>

<h3><a name="win_paste_mode"></a>Using Win as Paste Mode key instead of Ctrl <span class="ver">[v12.3+]</span></h3>
To use <kbd>Win</kbd> instead of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> for activating and controlling Paste Mode, set the option <var>WinForPasteMode</var> = 1 in the <em>[Advanced]</em> section of settings.ini. It is recommended to use the plugin <a href="settings.html#plugin_inieditor">IniEditor</a> to do so. Don't forget to restart Clipjump after updating Settings.ini.

<br><br>

<h3><a name="win_copy_cut"></a>Using Win-C and Win-X for copy and cut to Clipjump <span class="ver">[v12.5+]</span></h3>
With the setting "Use Win-based shortcut for copy/cut to Clipjump" in the Settings Editor, you can copy/cut to Clipjump using Win-C and Win-X respectively. 
Now, Ctrl-C and Ctrl-X will have no effect on Clipjump and the clipboard changes through them will be ignored. 
This setting changes the <span class="str">Using Win as Paste Mode key</span> (<a href="#win_paste_mode">Link</a>) setting with it. 
So you can use the usual Ctrl-C,X,V for interacting with system clipboard and Win-C,X,V for interacting with Clipjump clipboards.

<br><br>

<h3>Showing the Pasting tooltip</h3>
You can make Clipjump show a <code>Pasting..</code> tip when you paste some data. To do so, change the value of 
<var>Show_pasting_tip</var> in the <em>[Advanced]</em> section of Settings.ini to 1.

<br><br>

<h3><a name="prior">Changing default Task Priority</a></h3>
You can change default Clipjump Task priority from the Priority key in the System section of the Ini.
<br>Set Priority to H (high) to make Clipjump most responsive.<br> Priority Values can be-<br>
<pre>L (or Low), B (or BelowNormal), N (or Normal), A (or AboveNormal), H (or High), R (or Realtime)</pre>

<br><br>

<h3><a name="only_manual_monitor"></a>Capture clipboard changes only through Ctrl-C and X <span class="ver">[v12.5+]</span></h3>
Changing the setting <var>monitorClipboard</var> in the <em>Main</em> section of Settings.ini to <var>0</var> will make Clipjump ignore any clipboard change other than one done by Ctrl-C or Ctrl-X. (or Win-C and Win-X if you have enabled the <a href="#win_copy_cut">setting</a>)

<br><br>

<h3><a name="ram_flush"></a>Make Clipjump flush RAM contents to disk <span class="ver">[v12+]</span></h3>
The <var>RAM_flush</var> option when enabled instructs Clipjump to flush its RAM memory data to hard disk at needed intervals. 
Thus Clipjump will take much less RAM (&lt;= 1.5 MB) but the overall performance may be affected. I recommend keeping this option disabled (set to 0) which is what it is by default.
You can find <var>RAM_flush</var> in [System] section of Settings.ini

<br><br>

<h3><a name="pst_custom_pos">Show paste mode at fixed position</a></h3>
You can fix the Paste Mode's screen position by adding values to variables <var>pstMode_X</var> and <var>pstMode_Y</var> in the Advanced section of the Ini.<br>
The X coord is pixels from left of the screen whereas the Y coord is pixels from top of the screen.<br>
You can also leave either of the coords blank and only the specified axes (X or Y) will be fixed for the paste mode.
